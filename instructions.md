5. Ask the user, “Enter an integer: ” Input the user’s response from the keyboard, test the integer to see if it is even (use the modulus operator % and 2 to do this), and then output the result as shown below (several runs are shown):

</br>

		Enter an integer: 28
		The integer 28 is True.
</br>

		Enter an integer: 2049
		The integer 2049 is False.
